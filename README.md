# Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) Prediction for Insurance Policyholders

Insurance companies often struggle to distinguish between policyholders who are long-term, high-value customers and those who churn early. Without this insight, marketing spends are distributed evenly across the customer base, leading to inefficient campaigns and lost revenue opportunities.

The goal of this project is to predict Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) for each policyholder and enable data-driven customer segmentation to improve retention, upselling, and targeting efficiency.
